### Hi there 👋

My name is Marius and I am a DevOps enthusiast. My journey started as a Software Developer, later I became Software Architect before my focus shifted towards DevOps.

🏢 I'm currently working at [Xebia|Xpirit](https://xpirit.com/team/marius-boden/)

✍️ I'm co-author at [writeabout.net](https://writeabout.net/)

🌱 I'm currently deep diving into GitHub & AzureDevOps and learning every new stuff about software development that crosses my path 😉

💬 Ask me about DevOps, CI/CD, Container, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, Software Architecture and Software Development
